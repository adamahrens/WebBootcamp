      Do you see any <strong>Teletubbies</strong> in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it?
      Do you see a little Asian child with a <em>blank expression</em> on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it?
      No? Well, that's what you see at a toy store.
      And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant named <strong>Jeb</strong>.

      Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you.
      But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to me.
      Besides, I've already been through too much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.
